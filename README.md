# House Price Prediction App

This repository contains a Streamlit web application for predicting house prices based on various features such as square footage, location, number of bedrooms, and more. The app leverages a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions and stores data in a MySQL database.

## Project Structure

* **app.py** : Main application file that runs the Streamlit web app.
* **CONFIG/Database_conn.py** : Contains the function Create_connection to connect to the MySQL database.
* **CONFIG/insert_data.py** : Defines the insert_data function that inserts user input data and prediction results into the MySQL table.
* **notebook/Model/RandomRegressor_model.pkl** : Pre-trained model file.
* **requirements.txt** : List of dependencies required for the project.

## Installation

* Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Siddhesh2241/house-price-prediction.git
  cd house-price-prediction
  ```
* Install required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Set up the MySQL database with the appropriate schema 

* Place the pre-trained model file RandomRegressor_model.pkl in the notebook/Model directory.

## Usage

* Run the app locally
 ```bash
 streamlit run app.py
 ```
This will open a local server where you can interact with the app by inputting house details and receiving a price prediction.

## Data Description

**The app uses the following input features for prediction**

* bedrooms: Number of bedrooms
* bathrooms: Number of bathrooms
* sqft_living: Living area in square feet
* sqft_lot: Lot area in square feet
* floors: Number of floors
* waterfront: Indicator if the house is on the waterfront (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* view: View score (0–4)
* condition: Condition score (1–5)
* grade: Grade (1–13)
* sqft_above: Above-ground living area in square feet
* sqft_basement: Basement area in square feet
* yr_built: Year built
* yr_renovated: Year renovated (0 if never renovated)
* zipcode: Zip code
* lat: Latitude
* long: Longitude
* sqft_living15: Average living area of nearby homes
* sqft_lot15: Average lot area of nearby homes

## Model Training

The model used in this application is a Random Forest Regressor, 
trained on housing data similar to the famous King County housing dataset. 
The model is saved in the file RandomRegressor_model.pkl.

## MySQL Database Integration
The app includes an integration with MySQL to store input data along with the predicted house prices.
The table schema used for storing data is

```bash
CREATE TABLE house_data (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    bedrooms INT,
    bathrooms FLOAT,
    sqft_living INT,
    sqft_lot INT,
    floors INT,
    waterfront INT,
    view INT,
    condition INT,
    grade INT,
    sqft_above INT,
    sqft_basement INT,
    yr_built INT,
    yr_renovated INT,
    zipcode INT,
    lat FLOAT,
    long FLOAT,
    sqft_living15 INT,
    sqft_lot15 INT,
    prediction FLOAT
);
```

## Acknowledgements
This project is inspired by machine learning regression tasks, similar to predicting housing prices as seen in datasets like the King County Housing dataset. 
Special thanks to the open-source community for providing tools like Streamlit and MySQL integration with Python.
